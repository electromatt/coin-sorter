US Coin Sorter/Counter - Arduino by rleddington on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5257512

Summary:
Fun coin sorting project for electronics enthusiasts.  This is a remix of "US Coin Sorter Variant" by pjm237, which was itself a remix of "COINSORTER" by neoprenox which I believe is for the Euro coins.  If you're only interested in the coin sorting functionality, I highly recommend pjm237's awesome project!  It works amazingly well.  This version is for US coins only and has been modified to fit a series of IR sensors, and Arduino UNO, and a 16x2 LCD Display to show the total value as well as the coin counts for each denomination.It requires an Arduino UNO and several electronics components and some skill with a soldering iron.  I'm working on a video which I'll link here on how to build and program it.  I also have several left-over components for the projects since amazon requires you to buy multiple of each component.  Let me know if you're interested in a 'kit' for the electronics parts minus the Arduino.Here are links to many of the part's you'll need to complete this project:On/Off Switchhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08R5PLDBP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;th=1Reset Buttonhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08JHSG717/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Battery Connector (9v)https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08SL9X2YC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Perf Boardhttps://www.amazon.com/Prototyping-Circuit-Breadboards-Envistia-Mall/dp/B07RC68D5C/ref=sr_1_9?crid=1ZXDWSG1AOT2H&amp;keywords=perf+board+pcb&amp;qid=1645154923&amp;sprefix=perf+board+pcb%2Caps%2C92&amp;sr=8-9I/R Emitter Detectorhttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B07VK3PGR9/ref=sspa_dk_detail_1?psc=1&amp;pd_rd_i=B07VK3PGR9&amp;pd_rd_w=mrXWq&amp;pf_rd_p=0c758152-61cd-452f-97a6-17f070f654b8&amp;pd_rd_wg=NiSHA&amp;pf_rd_r=FP7WDQJFY9ZVJMRCE3D3&amp;pd_rd_r=65488dfe-573c-4f98-835d-fe27421df65a&amp;s=hi&amp;smid=A1THAZDOWP300U&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUFSNTZCRVRHNDE5VlomZW5jcnlwdGVkSWQ9QTA0NDk0ODIzMDEwRTk2U0w5RUpYJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA4NDAzMDIyMlNISkZGSkVVR1ZRJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfZGV0YWlsJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ==Arduino Uno R3https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EWOE0UU/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Jumper Wireshttps://www.amazon.com/Elegoo-EL-CP-004-Multicolored-Breadboard-arduino/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1B8AO7YB5JDNR&amp;keywords=jumper%2Bwires&amp;qid=1645155141&amp;s=industrial&amp;sprefix=jumper%2Bwires%2Cindustrial%2C92&amp;sr=1-2-spons&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzMEpaUDhBQkNLSkY3JmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwMjMwODUyMThYN0NQTUQxSFRZVCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwOTQ1MzIxMUVLUFZPSjk1OTFYOSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU&amp;th=1LCD Display Modulehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S7PJYM6/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o03_s02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Wirewrap Wirehttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWI20M0/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1Resistorshttps://www.amazon.com/BOJACK-Values-Resistor-Resistors-Assortment/dp/B08FD1XVL6/ref=sr_1_20?crid=24X4HM5JQWYHB&amp;keywords=1%2F4+watt+10K+ohm+resistor&amp;qid=1645155359&amp;s=industrial&amp;sprefix=1%2F4+watt+10k+ohm+resistor%2Cindustrial%2C114&amp;sr=1-20M3 Bolts/Nuts &amp; Washershttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08125LTBT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1
